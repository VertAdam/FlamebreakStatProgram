Using a screenshot of the end screen, will determine your skills and items.

To Do:
- Add GUI
- Get working for all screen types (prioritizing kevins, which is windowed and 1420x900)
- Finalize Outputs

Maybe:
- Use word recognititon to retrieve extra data (difficulty, time used, gold gained, etc.)
- Automate outputs to googlesheets
- Have program run in background so that no screenshot is required.
